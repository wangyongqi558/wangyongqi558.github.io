### 1. Abstract
METOR addresses the coupling of object localization and relationship recognition through an iterative mutual enhancement mechanism.

### 2. Methodology

![Methodology](/images/metor_method.png)
* **Mutual Enhancement**: Leveraging relationship context to refine object boundaries and vice versa.
* **$\text{METOR}$ Framework**: A unified transformer architecture for zero-shot generalization.

### 3. Key Results
New SOTA on VidVRD and VidOR benchmarks.
